## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Key Patterns and Approaches Used

1. **Testable Subclasses Pattern**
   ```typescript
   class TestableMessagesCommand extends RoomsMessagesCommand {
     protected createAblyRestClient(): any {
       return getMock<any>('ablyChatMock');
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Comprehensive SDK Mocking**
   - Mock Chat rooms with full functionality (messages, presence, reactions, typing, occupancy)
   - Mock Spaces with state synchronization (members, locations, cursors, locks)
   - Proper async/await handling and Promise-based APIs

3. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**
   - Invalid input validation
   - Network failure simulation
   - Resource cleanup testing
   - JSON output format validation

4. **Metrics and Performance Testing**
   - Rate limiting verification
   - Performance measurement and reporting
   - Concurrent operation testing
   - Resource usage monitoring

## ⚠️ Current Issues and Challenges

### Type Conflicts in Global Mock System
The main blocking issue is TypeScript type conflicts in the global `__TEST_MOCKS__` system:

1. **Base Command Expectations**
   ```typescript
   // src/base-command.ts expects:
   globalThis.__TEST_MOCKS__?: { ablyRestMock: Ably.Rest }
   ```

2. **Extended Interface Conflicts**
   - Integration tests need Chat, Spaces, and Realtime mocks
   - Multiple global type declarations creating conflicts
   - Interface signature mismatches between mock methods

3. **Specific Error Examples**
   ```
   error TS2403: Subsequent variable declarations must have the same type
   error TS2322: Type '(channelName: string) => MockChannel' is not assignable to type '() => any'
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps and Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Resolve Type System Conflicts**
   - Refactor global mock system to use a more flexible approach
   - Consider using dependency injection instead of global mocks
   - Implement proper TypeScript module augmentation

2. **Complete Missing Components**
   - React component tests for `packages/react-web-cli`
   - Additional E2E scenarios for Chat and Spaces
   - MCP server protocol compliance tests

3. **Test Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Centralized mock management system
   - Test data factories for consistent mock objects
   - Automated test coverage reporting

### Medium-term Enhancements

1. **Performance Testing Suite**
   - Load testing for Chat rooms with multiple participants
   - Spaces scalability testing with concurrent users
   - Benchmarking accuracy validation

2. **Cross-platform E2E Tests**
   - Browser compatibility testing
   - Mobile web CLI testing
   - Terminal server testing across different environments

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Automated test execution on PR creation
   - Coverage threshold enforcement
   - Performance regression detection
