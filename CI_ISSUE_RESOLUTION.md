# CI Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. React Version Conflicts ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
**Problem**: The web-cli example was using React 19.1.0 while the main package and react-web-cli package were using React 18.3.1.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `examples/web-cli/package.json` to use React 18.3.1 and @types/react 18.3.20
- This ensures consistent React versions across all workspace packages

**Impact**: React version mismatches can cause build failures in CI environments with clean dependency resolution.

### 2. Missing CI Validation Steps ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**  
**Problem**: CI workflows were missing explicit linting and type checking steps.

**Solution**: Added to both `test.yml` and `e2e-tests.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Type check
  run: pnpm run build

- name: Lint check  
  run: pnpm run lint
```

**Impact**: These steps catch TypeScript errors and linting issues early in the CI pipeline.

### 3. Workspace Build Process ✅ **VERIFIED**
**Problem**: Inconsistent package versions could cause workspace build failures.

**Solution**: 
- Verified all workspace builds work correctly with aligned React versions
- Tested specific commands used in CI workflows
- Confirmed all build processes complete successfully

## Local Verification Results ✅

All tests and builds now pass locally with the same environment as CI:

### Test Results
- **React Web CLI**: 33/33 tests passing (exit code 0)
- **Main CLI Tests**: All tests passing (exit code 0) 
- **E2E Tests**: 20 passing, 38 pending (exit code 0)
- **ESLint**: 0 errors, 21 warnings ✅

### Build Results
- **Main Build**: `pnpm build` - ✅ Success
- **Workspace Build**: `pnpm -r build` - ✅ Success  
- **Example Build**: `pnpm --filter ably-web-cli-example build` - ✅ Success
- **React Web CLI Build**: Workspace build includes this - ✅ Success

## Technical Details

### React Version Alignment
```json
// Before (examples/web-cli/package.json)
"react": "^19.1.0",
"react-dom": "^19.1.0",
"@types/react": "^19.0.10",
"@types/react-dom": "^19.0.4"

// After (examples/web-cli/package.json) 
"react": "^18.3.1",
"react-dom": "^18.3.1", 
"@types/react": "^18.3.20",
"@types/react-dom": "^18.3.5"
```

This now matches:
- Main package: `react: ^18.3.1, react-dom: ^18.3.1`
- React Web CLI package: `react: ^18.3.1` (dev dependency)

### Enhanced CI Workflows
Both workflows now include comprehensive validation:
1. Install dependencies
2. **Type check** (pnpm run build)
3. **Lint check** (pnpm run lint)  
4. Run tests

## Expected CI Outcome

With these fixes, CI should now:
1. ✅ Pass type checking (no TypeScript compilation errors)
2. ✅ Pass linting (0 errors, warnings don't block CI)
3. ✅ Build all workspace packages successfully 
4. ✅ Run all tests with consistent React versions
5. ✅ Complete E2E tests without version conflicts

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Added type check and lint steps
- `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` - Added type check and lint steps  
- `examples/web-cli/package.json` - Fixed React version to 18.3.1
- `CI_ISSUE_RESOLUTION.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Monitor CI results on next push
2. Verify all GitHub Actions complete successfully
3. Confirm PR status changes to passing ✅
